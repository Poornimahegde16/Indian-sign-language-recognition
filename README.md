# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for image classification. The model is trained on a dataset of images stored in Google Drive and is capable of predicting the class of a given image. The project also includes a web interface using Gradio for easy interaction with the model.
